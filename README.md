# Movies-ETL

This project is an exercise in the Extract Load and Transform pipeline. We first extracted the data from files located locally, then used a jupyter notebook for the transformation and exploratory analysis. The load step uses a sql database and PG admin. Once we had performed this ETL, we automated the process into a python function (challenge.py). Because there is no exploratory analysis

There are a number of assumtions made to automate this procedure. The first is that the format of each file will remain the same. If columns are added or removed the function may not perform the same way. The second is the format of the data, in particular the date and money columns. The code accounts for a few formats of data but if a new format is added there is nothing to deal with this format and the data will likely be dropeed. The third assumtion is the few assumtions we made when deciding which column to keep for the wiki or kaggle data. The assumtions we made for the data we had might not hold true for other data sets. The forth assumtion is that we do not have/do not want the adult movies. If you are looking at adult movies specifically, they will not show up in the final data. The last assumtion is that we decided which columns were important and which were not often by the number of data points in that column. If other datasets have more data points for these columns, they could be important but they will still be dropped.
